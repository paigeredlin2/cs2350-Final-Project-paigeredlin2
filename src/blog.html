                        It was such an amazing experience to finally meet the city of Portland, Oregon. This city is
                        actually one of our highest-listening populations. So we are so honored to finally perform live
                        for you all Portland-ers. The entire night was a blast. I don't think I saw Michael frown at
                        all! An achievement in itself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="d-none d-md-block">
                        Thank you to everyone that showed up. While this wasn't our first show ever, it feels like the
                        first performance where the people attending were there for us and not just live music. We are
                        very grateful for your support and hope to be back in the city of Portland soon!

                        Not that Fiona approves (or even knows) of this post, I find it neccessary to share about the
                        absolute tragedy that had befallen on our innocent Fiona last Tuesday. She had set up her
                        microphone as per usual, and after trying to make conversation with the audience. She sat back
                        on her stool and the leg broke clean off, sending dear Fiona into the ground. We are lucky that
                        she has no sense of shame, because after getting a new stool from an apologetic stage manager,
                        she continued the show. Anyway~ sorry for embarassing you Fiona but I think this is more of a
                        compliment of how dedicated you are and also how shameless.

                        We successfully convinced (bribed) our way into the 4th annual Q Festival in Renton, Washington!
                        We were able to meet so many new people and other bands. Then after our performance a man
                        approached us and offered us a contract to be our producer. Don't worry - we deliberated for a
                        week and with big smiles we can announce that we are officially signed with Radio Mars
                        Productions! We are forever thankful for this opprotunity and the Q Festival for providing us a
                        way to reach a larger audience.

                        Our big gruff teddy bear Michael has done the impossible. Not only did he half-way smile but he
                        also took a photo of himself. Michael has always refused to take photos, part of the reason we
                        don't have an official band photo with all four of us. However, as we were exploring the
                        countryside togethe - Michael spotted some cows (Which are spotted already - haha get it? Sorry)
                        and actually took a selfie. After much convincing we were able to post this photo with his
                        permission.

                        After being in the studio for barely 20 minutes Abby fell asleep on the couch. Meaning that no
                        one else had anywhere to sit. Poor Michael is still complaining about how sore his knees are
                        after kneeling on the floor for hours. I'm sure that nobody will forgive Abby for this.
